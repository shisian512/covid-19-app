# My Covid-19 App

This is a simple Tkinter-based application that fetches Covid-19 data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly format. Please note that the API used for fetching data in this app is no longer supported, which may affect the functionality of the app. The code provided here is for educational purposes and can be used as a reference or starting point for building similar applications.

## Features

- Displays Covid-19 data including today's cases, today's deaths, active cases, critical cases, total cases, total recovered, and the country's name.
- Utilizes Tkinter for creating a graphical user interface.
- Fetches Covid-19 data from an external API.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the Python script `covid_app.py` using a Python interpreter.
3. The app will open in a new window, displaying the Covid-19 data.

## Note

The API used in this app (`https://corona-rest-api.herokuapp.com/Api/`) is no longer supported, and the app's functionality may be affected. It's recommended to replace the API with a functional one if you intend to use this app to fetch real-time Covid-19 data.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this app:

- `tkinter` for creating the graphical user interface.
- `requests` for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the API.

## Disclaimer

This app was developed for educational purposes and serves as a demonstration of creating a basic Covid-19 data display app using Tkinter and API calls. The code may need modifications to work with a functional Covid-19 API.
